# Machine Learning Homeworks – Armenian Code Academy

This repository contains my completed machine learning homeworks from the
**Introduction to Machine Learning** course at **Armenian Code Academy (ACA)**,
including my **final course project**.

## Topics Covered
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks

## Final Project
The repository also includes my **final project**, where I applied multiple
machine learning concepts learned during the course to solve a real-world
problem, covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch

## Notes
All assignments and the final project were completed independently as part of
ACA coursework.
